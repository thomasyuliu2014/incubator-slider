# How to create a Slider package for Accumulo?

  mvn clean package -DskipTests -Paccumulo-app-package-maven
  OR
  mvn clean package -DskipTests -Paccumulo-app-package -Dpkg.version=1.6.1 \
    -Dpkg.name=accumulo-1.6.1-bin.tar.gz -Dpkg.src=/local/path/to/tarball

App package can be found in
  app-packages/accumulo/target/slider-accumulo-app-package-*.zip

In the first case, the version number of the app package will match the
slider version, and in the second case it will match the pkg.version
(intended to be the accumulo version).

Verify the content using
  zip -Tv slider-accumulo-app-package*.zip

appConfig-default.json and resources-default.json are not required to be packaged.
These files are included as reference configuration for Slider apps and are suitable
for a one-node cluster.

In the maven packaging case, the version of Accumulo used for the app package
can be adjusted by adding a flag such as
  -Daccumulo.version=1.5.1

**Note that the LICENSE.txt and NOTICE.txt that are bundled with the app
package are designed for Accumulo 1.6.0 only and may need to be modified to be
applicable for other versions of the app package.

Note also that the sample appConfig-default.json provided only works with Accumulo 1.6,
while for Accumulo 1.5 the instance.volumes property must be replaced with
instance.dfs.dir (and it cannot use the provided variable ${DEFAULT_DATA_DIR}
which is an HDFS URI).

A less descriptive file name can be specified with
-Dapp.package.name=accumulo_160 which would create a file accumulo_160.zip.

# Building Native Libraries

Accumulo works better with its native libraries, and these must be built
manually for Accumulo releases 1.6.0 and greater.  They should be built on a
machine Accumulo will be deployed on, or an equivalent.  The procedure below
illustrates the steps for extracting and rebuilding the Accumulo app package
with native libraries, in the case of Accumulo version 1.6.0.  You will need a
C++ compiler/toolchain installed to build this library, and JAVA_HOME must be
set.

  unzip ${app.package.name}.zip package/files/accumulo*gz
  cd package/files/
  gunzip accumulo-1.6.0-bin.tar.gz
  tar xvf accumulo-1.6.0-bin.tar
  accumulo-1.6.0/bin/build_native_library.sh
  tar uvf accumulo-1.6.0-bin.tar accumulo-1.6.0
  rm -rf accumulo-1.6.0
  gzip accumulo-1.6.0-bin.tar
  cd ../../
  zip ${app.package.name}.zip -r package
  rm -rf package

# Export Control

This distribution includes cryptographic software. The country in which you
currently reside may have restrictions on the import, possession, use, and/or
re-export to another country, of encryption software. BEFORE using any
encryption software, please check your country's laws, regulations and
policies concerning the import, possession, or use, and re-export of encryption
software, to see if this is permitted. See <http://www.wassenaar.org/> for more
information.

The U.S. Government Department of Commerce, Bureau of Industry and Security
(BIS), has classified this software as Export Commodity Control Number (ECCN)
5D002.C.1, which includes information security software using or performing
cryptographic functions with asymmetric algorithms. The form and manner of this
Apache Software Foundation distribution makes it eligible for export under the
License Exception ENC Technology Software Unrestricted (TSU) exception (see the
BIS Export Administration Regulations, Section 740.13) for both object code and
source code.

The following provides more details on the included cryptographic software:

Apache Slider uses the built-in java cryptography libraries. See Oracle's
information regarding Java cryptographic export regulations for more details:
http://www.oracle.com/us/products/export/export-regulations-345813.html

Apache Slider uses the SSL libraries from the Jetty project distributed by the
Eclipse Foundation (http://eclipse.org/jetty).
